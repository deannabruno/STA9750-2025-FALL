# Executive Summary

As a part of Netflix's commitment to delivering high-quality and accessible entertainment content, what we may call 'gourmet cheeseburgers', this mini-project aims to analyze Global and Country Top 10 datasets in order to identify recent streaming successes. The analysis focuses on viewership, cumulative weeks in global charts, and country-specific trends. Key insights include:

-   Hindi Films dominating the Indian market.
-   Marketing dynamics in the United States.
-   Global viewing trends across languages and formats.

Most importantly, all findings highlight key opportunities for streaming powerhouse Netflix to further capitalize on its content strategies.

# Acquire Data

## Task 1: Data Acquisition

```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}
```

# Data Import and Preparation

## Task 2: Data Cleaning

```{r}
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
```

### Examine Global Data Structure

```{r}
glimpse(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

### Convert "N/A" to Proper N/A Values

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    mutate(season_title = if_else(season_title == "N/A", NA_character_, season_title))
```

### Verify for Successful Cleaning

```{r}
glimpse(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

## Task 3: Data Import

```{r}
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, na = "N/A")
```

### Verify for Successful Data Import

```{r}
glimpse(COUNTRY_TOP_10)
```

# Initial Data Exploration

```{r}
library(DT)
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    head(n = 20) |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE))
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
format_titles <- function(df){
    colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
    df
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    select(-season_title) |>
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    mutate(`runtime_(minutes)` = round(60 * runtime)) |>
    select(-season_title, 
           -runtime) |>
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

## Task 4: Exploratory Questions

### Question 1: How many different countries does Netflix operate in?

# NETFLIX TAKES A TRIP TO INDIA: A Chance of Expanding in the World's Most Populated Country

![](docs/NPFI.jpg.webp)

*Written By Deanna Bruno*

**NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 2025** Netflix has announced its record breaking success in India, driven by a need for Hindi-language content in the form of films. The Bollywood-style entertainment has dominated charts on Netflix, generating not only over 7,464,700,000 global hours watched, but 27,234,040,000 global views. Netflix has full intentions on expanding its reach further to India's 1.451 billion population.

Leading the movement are popular films such as: RRR (Hindi), Haseen Dillruba, and Sooryavanshi, who have all sat in the Top 10 Films on Netflix for over 20 weeks straight. Now there are individuals who may watch Hindi-language films in the United States or other countries, so these results are based on these limitations. The ones that are released in India have all been celebrated throughout India, with more to come up until the end of 2025.

These films showcase the potential for Netflix to continue strategically investing time, money, and effort in authentic regional films that resonate with Indian audiences.

# HAPPY GILMORE SWINGS BACK: A Classic Comedy Opens the Door for Film Revivals on Netflix

![](docs/HG2P.jpg)

*Written By Deanna Bruno*

**NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 2025** The beloved cult classic comedy, Happy Gilmore, has returned nearly 30 years later. Starring Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore 2 has attracted audiences, old and new. Streaming data shows that the film has accumulated over 223,700,000 hours within the first give weeks of its release, and has remained in the global Top 10 for those five weeks. This highlights the nostalgic appeal the film has, with even more to come in the future.

The original Happy Gilmore release from 1996 had also seen success from the sequel, with over 41,100,000 hours viewed globally, and spending three weeks in the Top 10. The release of Happy Gilmore 2 has shown just how successful reviving classic films can be, and Netflix has the potential to capitalize on this.

Streaming analytics indicate that reviving timeless and iconic humor or characters from the past can open doors to a new generation of viewers, while also appealing to those who grew up with the original. Celebrity cameos, modern twists, and social media buzz had furthered its popularity.

This potential for success raises an intriguing question for future films: which classics should they consider reviving next?
