## About Me

Hi there, I'm Deanna! I'm a Master's student at Baruch College in the Marketing Analytics program. This site is a submission hub for my STA 9750 - Software Tools for Data Analysis course.

I have recently graduated from Stony Brook University, earning my Bachelor of Science in Business Management, with specializations in Finance, Marketing, and Operations Management. I hope to expand my analytical knowledge in Professor Weylandt's course!
